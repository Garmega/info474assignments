# TreemapChart.js API Reference

Easily configurable D3 Treemap Chart

## Usage

First get a data file where the data is structured in a natural hierarchy. For example, in module 9 we had a file where the natural heirarchy was every country having a parent region. Load this file using the csv d3 function. Should look something like this: d3.csv('data/prepped_data.csv', function(error, data) {}.
